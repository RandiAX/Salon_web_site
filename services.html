    <h1>Our Treatments</h1>
    <p>
        We are offering international level treatments <br>
        for our valuable customers. You can see some <br>
        of them below.

            <h3>Salon Keratin Treatments</h3>
            <p>Keratin is a type of protein, one of the main components of <br>
                your hair. A keratin hair treatment, sometimes called Cezanne, <br>
                or Brazilian keratin treatment (but there are other types and <br>
                brands), is a chemical procedure for dry frizzy hair that <br>
                makes it straight, smooth, and shiny. A proper hair salon <br>
                keratin treatment with the right maintenance yields amazing <br>
                results lasting up to 6 months.</p>

            <h3>Professional Protein Treatments</h3>
            <p>Protein treatments are the best salon hair treatments for <br>
                damaged hair. Many women choose them for restoring their dry <br>
                brittle hair and boosting its growth. Protein helps to <br>
                prevent breakage and reinforce the structure of the hair <br>
                strand by filling in weak and damaged areas. There are <br>
                various protein hair smoothing salon treatments, and each <br>
                makes your locks stronger by providing hydrolyzed protein <br>
                directly to the follicle. Right after a protein treatment <br>
                for hair in a salon, you will see and feel the difference. <br>
                The effect will last 4-6 weeks.</p>

            <h3>In-Salon Scalp Treatments</h3>
            <p>When taking care of the hair and doing moisture treatments, <br>
                many people tend to forget that they need to focus on the <br>
                scalp as well and underrate salon scalp treatments! If you <br>
                feel like your hair never really looks clean enough, it’s <br>
                only the hair and scalp treatment that can prevent it from <br>
                getting excessively oily too fast. Scalp treatments come <br>
                in a variety of forms, such as scrubs, oils, foams, sprays, etc.

            <h3>Clarifying Treatment</h3>
            <p>A clarifying hair treatment at a salon, or a detox treatment, <br>
                as we call it, is a ‘reset button’ for your scalp and locks <br>
                that removes dirt and strips away product buildup. This is <br>
                an extremely effective salon therapy that makes your hair <br>
                thicker, way easier to style, and boosts its growth. If you <br>
                see that your hair has become too weak, stringy, and <br>
                completely lifeless, consider trying this procedure.
            </p>

            <h3>Salon Hot Oil Treatment</h3>
            <p>Doing a hair hot oil treatment salon session may be quite helpful <br>
                for all hair types. It’s probably the best salon treatment for <br>
                damaged hair you can get, as it brings life back to your locks <br>
                by restoring the hair structure. Olive, castor, or coconut oil <br>
                can serve as a great dry hair remedy, so go ahead, book a hair <br>
                consultation, and nourish your hair! The procedure itself <br>
                includes shampooing, applying oils to your hair and scalp if <br>
                needed, heating, and washing oils out.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional In-Salon Rebonding Treatment</h3>
            <p>Looks almost the same as relaxing treatment, but rebonding uses <br>
                much stronger components. Usually, it is a perming mix, plus a <br>
                flat iron. However, your hair looks much straighter than after <br>
                simple relaxing.
